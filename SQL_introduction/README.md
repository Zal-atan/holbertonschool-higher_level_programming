# This is a Readme for the Python-More_Classes Project
## In this project we will be going into more depth about classes, objects, and methods in Python

# Author - Ethan Zalta

## There are 17 tasks in this project with 4 Bonus Tasks


## **Task 0**
* Write a script that lists all databases of your MySQL server.

## **Task 1**
* Write a script that creates the database hbtn_0c_0 in your MySQL server.

    * If the database hbtn_0c_0 already exists, your script should not fail
    * You are not allowed to use the SELECT or SHOW statements

## **Task 2**
* Write a script that deletes the database hbtn_0c_0 in your MySQL server.

    * If the database hbtn_0c_0 doesn’t exist, your script should not fail
    * You are not allowed to use the SELECT or SHOW statements


## **Task 3**
* Write a script that lists all the tables of a database in your MySQL server.

    * The database name will be passed as argument of mysql command (in the following example: mysql is the name of the database)

## **Task 4**
* Write a script that creates a table called first_table in the current database in your MySQL server.

    * first_table description:
        * id INT
        * name VARCHAR(256)
    * The database name will be passed as an argument of the mysql command
    * If the table first_table already exists, your script should not fail
    * You are not allowed to use the SELECT or SHOW statements


## **Task 5**
* Write a script that prints the full description of the table first_table from the database hbtn_0c_0 in your MySQL server.

    * The database name will be passed as an argument of the mysql command
    * You are not allowed to use the DESCRIBE or EXPLAIN statements

## **Task 6**
* Write a script that lists all rows of the table first_table from the database hbtn_0c_0 in your MySQL server.

    * All fields should be printed
    * The database name will be passed as an argument of the mysql command

## **Task 7**
* Write a script that inserts a new row in the table first_table (database hbtn_0c_0) in your MySQL server.

    * New row:
        * id = 89
        * name = Best School
    * The database name will be passed as an argument of the mysql command

## **Task 8**
* Write a script that displays the number of records with id = 89 in the table first_table of the database hbtn_0c_0 in your MySQL server.

    * The database name will be passed as an argument of the mysql command

## **Task 9**
* Write a script that creates a table second_table in the database hbtn_0c_0 in your MySQL server and add multiples rows.

    * second_table description:
        * id INT
        * name VARCHAR(256)
        * score INT
    * The database name will be passed as an argument to the mysql command
    * If the table second_table already exists, your script should not fail
    * You are not allowed to use the SELECT and SHOW statements
    * Your script should create these records:
        * id = 1, name = “John”, score = 10
        * id = 2, name = “Alex”, score = 3
        * id = 3, name = “Bob”, score = 14
        * id = 4, name = “George”, score = 8

## **Task 10**
* Write a script that lists all records of the table second_table of the database hbtn_0c_0 in your MySQL server.

    * Results should display both the score and the name (in this order)
    * Records should be ordered by score (top first)
    * The database name will be passed as an argument of the mysql command

## **Task 11**
* Write a script that lists all records with a score >= 10 in the table second_table of the database hbtn_0c_0 in your MySQL server.

    * Results should display both the score and the name (in this order)
    * Records should be ordered by score (top first)
    * The database name will be passed as an argument of the mysql command

## **Task 12**
* Write a script that updates the score of Bob to 10 in the table second_table.

    * You are not allowed to use Bob’s id value, only the name field
    * The database name will be passed as an argument of the mysql command

## **Task 13**
* Write a script that removes all records with a score <= 5 in the table second_table of the database hbtn_0c_0 in your MySQL server.

    * The database name will be passed as an argument of the mysql command

## **Task 14**
* Write a script that computes the score average of all records in the table second_table of the database hbtn_0c_0 in your MySQL server.

    * The result column name should be average
    * The database name will be passed as an argument of the mysql command


## **Task 15**
* Write a script that lists the number of records with the same score in the table second_table of the database hbtn_0c_0 in your MySQL server.

    * The result should display:
        * the score
        * the number of records for this score with the label number
    * The list should be sorted by the number of records (descending)
    * The database name will be passed as an argument to the mysql command

## **Task 16**
* Write a script that lists all records of the table second_table of the database hbtn_0c_0 in your MySQL server.

    * Don’t list rows without a name value
    * Results should display the score and the name (in this order)
    * Records should be listed by descending score
    * The database name will be passed as an argument to the mysql command

## **Bonus Task 100**
* Write a script that converts hbtn_0c_0 database to UTF8 (utf8mb4, collate utf8mb4_unicode_ci) in your MySQL server.

* You need to convert all of the following to UTF8:
    * Database hbtn_0c_0
    * Table first_table
    * Field name in first_table

## **Bonus Task 101**
* Import in hbtn_0c_0 database this table dump: download

* Write a script that displays the average temperature (Fahrenheit) by city ordered by temperature (descending).

## **Bonus Task 102**
* Import in hbtn_0c_0 database this table dump: download (same as Temperatures #0)

* Write a script that displays the top 3 of cities temperature during July and August ordered by temperature (descending).

## **Bonus Task 103**
* Import in hbtn_0c_0 database this table dump: download (same as Temperatures #0)

* Write a script that displays the max temperature of each state (ordered by State name).
