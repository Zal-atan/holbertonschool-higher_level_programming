# This is a Readme for the Python-Imports_Moduels Project
## In this project we will learning to work with importing functions and modules as well as using the built in function dir().

# Author - Ethan Zalta

## There are 6 tasks in this project with 4 Bonus Tasks


## **Task 0**
* Write a program that imports the function def add(a, b): from the file add_0.py and prints the result of the addition 1 + 2 = 3

## **Task 1**
* Write a program that imports functions from the file calculator_1.py, does some Maths, and prints the result.

## **Task 2**
* Write a program that prints the number of and the list of its arguments.

    * The output should be:
        * Number of argument(s) followed by argument (if number is one) or arguments (otherwise), followed by
        * : (or . if no arguments were passed) followed by
        * a new line, followed by (if at least one argument),
        * one line per argument:
            * the position of the argument (starting at 1) followed by :, followed by the argument value and a new line

## **Task 3**
* Write a program that prints the result of the addition of all arguments

## **Task 4**
* Write a program that prints all the names defined by the compiled module hidden_4.pyc (please download it locally in your sandbox using curl).

## **Task 5**
* Write a program that imports the variable a from the file variable_load_5.py and prints its value.


## **Bonus Task 100**
*Write a program that imports all functions from the file calculator_1.py and handles basic operations.

## **Bonus Task 101**
*Write a program that prints #pythoniscool, followed by a new line, in the standard output.

## **Bonus Task 101**
*Write the Python function def magic_calculation(a, b): that does exactly the same as the following Python bytecode:

## **Bonus Task 101**
*Write a program that prints the alphabet in uppercase, followed by a new line.
